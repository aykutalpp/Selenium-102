# Selenium-102
I have used Page Object Model for writing the tests, as it helps organizing the tests, maintenance and easy readability and reuse.

----Tools Used-----

Following tools have been used in writing and running the tests:

1-) Programming Language: Java
2-) Web Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver
3-) WebDriverManager is used for managing the drivers.
4-) Test Runner: TestNG
5-) Build Tool: Maven
